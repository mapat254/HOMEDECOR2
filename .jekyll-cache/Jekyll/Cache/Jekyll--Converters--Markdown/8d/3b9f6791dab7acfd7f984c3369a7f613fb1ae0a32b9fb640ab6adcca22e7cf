<p>The color palette of a <strong>Mediterranean exterior look</strong> is crucial in establishing the overall mood and ambiance.  Think warm, earthy tones that evoke the sun-kissed landscapes of the region.  Key colors include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Warm Whites and Creams:</strong> These create a bright, airy feel, reflecting the abundant sunlight.  Consider using a slightly textured whitewash for a more authentic look.</li>
  <li><strong>Earthy Browns and Terracottas:</strong> These represent the natural tones of the landscape, from clay tiles to sun-baked earth.  Use them in accents, such as roof tiles, window frames, or decorative elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Muted Blues and Greens:</strong> These evoke the sea and the lush vegetation characteristic of the Mediterranean.  Use them sparingly, perhaps in shutters, doors, or trim, to add depth and contrast.</li>
  <li><strong>Ochre and Yellows:</strong> These warm, sunny hues add a touch of vibrancy and energy to the overall palette.</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid overly bright or saturated colors.  The <strong>Mediterranean exterior look</strong> prioritizes a sense of calm and understated elegance.  Consider using a color wheel to create harmonious combinations that complement each other without being overwhelming.  Remember to consider the surrounding environment and your homeâ€™s orientation to the sun when selecting your colors.  A south-facing home might benefit from lighter colors to reflect heat, while a north-facing home might appreciate warmer tones to enhance sunlight.</p>
